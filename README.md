1. Introduction
  Time series forecasting plays a critical role in decision-making across industries such as finance, energy management, and supply chain optimization. With the increasing complexity of real-world data, traditional forecasting models often struggle to capture long-term dependencies and non-linear patterns.
This project explores the use of a deep learning–based Encoder–Decoder Transformer model with self-attention to improve forecasting accuracy and compares its performance against a traditional SARIMA baseline.

2. Problem Statement
  Traditional statistical time series models such as SARIMA are effective for linear and stationary data but have limitations when handling complex temporal dependencies, seasonality, and non-linear trends.
The challenge addressed in this project is to design a robust attention-based forecasting model capable of learning long-range dependencies and to empirically evaluate whether it outperforms a classical baseline model on the same dataset.

3. Objectives
To preprocess and structure multivariate time series data suitable for deep learning models
To implement an Encoder–Decoder Transformer architecture tailored for sequence-to-sequence forecasting
To apply self-attention mechanisms for capturing temporal relationships
To perform hyperparameter tuning and validation-based training
To compare forecasting performance with a SARIMA baseline model
To evaluate models using standard metrics: RMSE, MAE, and MAPE
