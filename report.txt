Title: Advanced Time Series Forecasting using Attention-Based Deep Learning

Dataset:
A synthetic multivariate time series dataset was generated using NumPy. The dataset consists of three correlated variables exhibiting trend, seasonality, and stochastic noise.

Preprocessing:
Data was normalized using MinMax scaling. Sliding window lookback sequences of 24 time steps were created. The dataset was split into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets.

Model Architecture:
A Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture with multi-head self-attention was implemented in PyTorch. The model captures long-range dependencies more effectively than traditional recurrent models.

Hyperparameter Tuning:
A grid search was performed on learning rates (0.001, 0.0005) and embedding dimensions (32, 64). The model with the lowest validation loss was selected.

Baseline Model:
A SARIMA model was implemented as a statistical baseline.

Evaluation:
Performance was evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and MAPE on the test set. The attention-based model outperformed the baseline across all metrics.

Computational Cost:
The Transformer model has higher computational cost compared to SARIMA but delivers superior forecasting accuracy.

Conclusion:
Attention mechanisms significantly enhance forecasting performance for complex multivariate time series data.
